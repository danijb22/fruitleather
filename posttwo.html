       Hey All!  
       <br><br>
       I want to give a massive shout out to the dear friend who helped me download
       <br>
       Github, learn how to embed a gif, and get through almost 9 years of my life.      
       <br>
       I reached out to Viktor because I wanted this site to be all owned and made
       <br>
       by me and Fruitleather. We both agreed on avoiding the rigmarole of Wix and  
       <br>
       it was a wonderful full-circle moment to finally give into html YEARS after 
       <br>
       we had first met in the second floor computer lab and I vehemently opposed  
       <br> 
       all that tech stuff due to my brother being some sort of savant and my school  
       <br>
       being packed with similar types and my stubborness inhereted from both sides 
       <br>
       of the family. 
       <br><br>
       Viktor has always been a consistently brilliant friend. Encouraging confidence
       <br>
       and self-sufficency in STEM and in the choices I make, the feelings I feel,
       <br>
       and dreams I have. He wrote something I'd like to share here on the blog to
       <br> 
       to spotlight a great friend with a very important perspective he has begun the 
       <br> 
       journey of sharing. It touches on homelessness, shame, and a very realistic 
       <br>
       assesment of American economic grind and lack of social mobility. I'm so very
       <br>
       appreciative of the guts it takes to write this way. Thanks Viktor. :)
       <br><br>
