        Welp.
        <br>
        <br>
        We've done it again boys. 
        <br> <br>
        We've eaten a whole 'nother year up and are about do the same dang thing to this dang one. 
        <br> <br>
        Just wanna say. Thanks.
        <br> <br>
         We really appreciate how much this year has been so much more different and bigger and crazier than last year. What a gift a true true gift, and we couldn't've done it without every single person who bore witness to whatever it is we're doing.
        <br> 
        Whether you came to shows or looked at our three videos or went on soundclown or dis blawg or bought tapes?? or CDs????? or a sock? ?? ? ? we couldn't be more grateful for your support. While being percieved makes us uncomfortable, we do know really truly how much it means just that you put yr pants on (or didn't) and showed up for us. God bless. 
        <br> <br>
        We're also making a big grinnin' shout out to every band we played with. To all those incredibly talented, thoughtful, ambitious bands we played with in 2023, we appreciate the risk you took puttin' known stinkers like us on a bill with you (and boy did we stink up the place) but in the end it paid off because we're all best friends now and made one bagillion dollars from door.
        <br><br>
        We also couldn't be more prouder of ourselves in OR out of the fruitbasket. Some of us went to school for The Brady Bunch. Some whiteknuckled. Some got very thirsty and cut up paper. Others played ☆. *☆˚Tennisﾟ✧･☆. Some fruits had too many speakers. Even more still cried in the middle of nowhere! Go us for doing that crazy little thing called love. And heck! Finally, some music!!!
        <br><br>
        Here's to 2024! May it whack you right upside th' 'ead!!
