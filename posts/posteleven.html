        We've done it again boys. we've eaten a whole nother year up and are about to shit it out into this dang one. 
        <br> <br>
        Just wanna say. Thanks.
        <br> <br>
         We really appreciate how much this year has been so much more different and bigger and crazier than last year. What a gift a true true gift, and we couldn't've done it without every single person who bore witness to whatever it is we're doing.
        <br> 
        Whether you came to shows or looked at our three videos or went on soundclown or dis blawg or bought tapes?? or CDs????? or a sock? ?? ? ? we couldn't be more grateful or more prouder of ourselves for doing that crazy little thing called love.
        <br><br>
        here's to 2024! may it whack you right upside th' 'ed!!
