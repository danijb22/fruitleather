        Just hung out for an hour with a guy named John. We were sitting on the grassy part next to the off ramp for Lakeshore and Lawrence. His 
        <br> 
        friend had had a meltdown and was waving a sword around and damn near 15 cops (including a chief and a paddy wagon??) showed up <br> 
        to arrest him and send him to Masonic for “treatment”. He told John, “take my dog, take my dog” and so now he was feeding Viktor dried <br> 
        dog jerky and smoking menthols and drinking natty ice and wondering what the fuck to do. I stopped by because they’re disappearing 
        <br> 
        people and my brother’s godmother got at me years ago for the selfish act that was getting a flip phone. “Well then how can you record <br> 
        when the police are doing things to people?” and so I feel guilty cause I really can’t record, and so that motivates me to pull up and watch <br> 
        the police and see if I can support the people getting harassed by them. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        
        
        John went to Lane Tech. Small world. He’s 42 and came from Honolulu when he was 9 and used to really fucking breakdance like, 
        <br> 
        “windmills and shit”, but now he really just bikes and walks and smokes and drinks and does his tough CNA job he doesn’t really like, cause <br> 
        nurses don’t do any of the work they just “pass pills and call to check in with the doctor. They can smoke weed.” But the nursing assistant <br> 
        does all the work. I didn’t know that. I always thought the nurse WAS the assistant and was doing all the work, but it seems like they get to <br> 
        pass the buck too. It’s kinda depressing. Maybe one day John will have an assistant. Or a different job.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        
        
        It’s always tense in conversations, especially with strangers, when someone has to go to the bathroom. The flow, the mood, the energy
        <br> 
         gets changed and you’re each left to your own devices, summing the other up, evaluating the conversation and how it’s going. It gives the <br> 
         opportunity to step back and remember yourself which adds a bit of complexity when you eventually try to get back into it after the
         <br> 
        person who went to piss comes back. This time it lead to me saying that frustrating “I’m gonna have to head out in like 20 minutes” thing. I <br> 
        do it with the kids, give people a warning when I’m about to leave, or when class time is almost over. I really don’t like ending things, and I  <br> 
        wished that a part of me could stay and carry things out with every person until we hate each other or die. I just feel bad about going. I <br> 
        feel guilty ignoring people and I feel guilty abandoning them, and I think this has lead to some dangerous, or laborious situations.
         <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        
        
        And yeah, I couldn’t give him my number. That part frustrates me too. It sucks to have few people in the world. It sucks to be rejected. I just
        <br> 
         don’t want to add bitter, sullen energy into the world, and I also really don’t want him to hate me and think of me as some POS for popping <br> 
        a squat for an hour and chatting just to leave. But an hour is not a commitment and as I drove away I noticed a real sign of growth which <br> 
        was that I simply had to accept that that interaction was all I could offer at the moment, and I could not change what he decided to take <br> 
        away from our encounter. I could only hope that it made a positive impact on his day, but really you just never know. It could’ve fucked with <br> 
        him so bad he never recovered. I have to live with that and own it. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        
        
        We laughed a lot though, which isn’t nothing. He kept asking if I knew Ari, the guy who got arrested and I had to tell him no, I didn't. 
        <br>
            I don’t know if  he was already drunk or maybe I looked like someone Ari knew, or I just sort of fit in, but it wasn’t disconcerting. 
            <br>
                It felt like a compliment.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        
        
        He said that 20s is any kind of crazy, and 30s is calculated crazy, and honestly I’ve got a lot to look forward to. I told him I’m crazy but I 
        <br> 
        lost my crazy and am trying to get it back. The yin and yang of craziness. It’s a balance. He says in your 20s anything goes but in your 30s <br> 
        you go, “well.. I know this is crazy, but…”. I don’t covet the craziness he’s had, and I don’t truly want to experience it, but I do long for what <br> 
        “crazy” means for me. What a calculated sort of impulsiveness might do for my soul relative to the time and place of my life. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I don’t know how I feel about this sort of thing I do. Hanging out with strange men sometimes. Talking to them and asking them about their <br> 
        lives. I feel my presence is wanted, enjoyed, and that I can infiltrate easily with my age and perceived gender and appearance, and I get a  <br> 
        lot out of it too. Insight and company and risk. I don’t think it’s bad, but sometimes I wonder if I offer too much just by being there. That 
        <br> 
        whole situation of abandonment. Do I never reach out and ask if they’re okay or want company? Or only reach out when I know I can 
         <br> 
        commit to a long-term friendship? I think it’s better to just be honest and leave when I have to, which gives us another thing in common. <br> 
        The sadness of being alone again. 
        <br> 
        <br>

        His tip for picking up girls is: Just be yourself.
