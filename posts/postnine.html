 max asked for these lyrics here you go max:
 <br> <br> <br>
 progress is not linear 
 however our current expected
 artistic process stops for nothing
 it looks like
 hurt to
 twist to
 mimic to
 contain to
 sell
 it looks like everyone singing about a breakup for years
 so many pathetic passes at political stance
 apathetic whiteness and micro-trend nostalgia-mining
 it looks like avoiding poor people black people trans people 
 working in tech or living in a van or building a studio
 and having an artist mixer next Wednesday 
 always the folk rock post punk
 the new country solo on the pale fender
 the shoe gaze the shoe gaze is in
 sounds like
 the duplicator losing quality 
 making a legend wear shein and letting him go thirsty 
 dont even ask him how his day was
 don’t go to New York you’ll never play
 get all your friends to drink
 get all your friends to smoke
 have to take a bump to play a show
 it looks like cutting a slab of your soul 
 throwing it down to plate 
 asking for less than a penny
 <br>
 write a song 
 and then what?
 get a band to play it 
 then what?
 beg some anti-labor fuck to think you’re well-liked enough and safe enough to be booked 
 and then what?
 scream it on a stage 
 then what?
 put it in an album 
 and then what?
 by the way release show on October first
 talk about it all the time
 and then go on tour 
 and then what?
 and then what?
 have a child born into dust and gravel air
 who you will have to see drown
 burn like an egg on the pavement
 and then what?
 <br>
 continuous engagement
 that’s what your fans want
 spineless men who spend their earnings on defense technology
 who do you sound like?
 how warm is your sound?
 <br>
 <br>
 what else can I do?
 joy is plagiarized and consumed
 my art is re-creatable, commercial, and provocative on banal value terms
 I see the mill-churn
 the milieu of hundreds of thousands branding themselves
 the scent of rotting flesh reeks on the stage
 I am not willing to fashion myself into a worthy inheritor
 I cannot continue to pimp myself out to myself
 I cannot bring myself to chase 15 seconds of attention
 and yet still here I am
 nothing risked
 nothing risked
 nothing risked
 <br>
 and nothing lost but time time time
 <br>
 in the face of everything 
 I am refusing 
 I refuse 
 I have lived in comfort for too long
 I must find others and cling to them purposefully
 and reject the realism
 reject inevitability 
 reject consistent age-ed structure
 <br>
 do not acquiesce my love
 do not let them steal a healthy life away from your children
 do not let them kill you
 how hard alone is it to make meaning of your minutes
 your life
 and then to rearrange and synthesize into something you’re proud enough to sing
 and now you must beat out everyone
 claw their eyes out in favor of The Castle
 the call center 
 the likely scam
 like A Night On Bald Mountain
 they take your money 
 they take it from every inch of the path they’ve laid out for you
 the toll the toll the toll
 <br>
 i am america's last great export
 i am a dry turkey
 i am so marketable you wouldn’t believe
