 max asked for these lyrics here you go max:
 <br> <br> <br>
 progress is not linear 
 <br>
 however our current expected
 <br>
 artistic process stops for nothing
 <br>
 it looks like
 <br>
 hurt to
 <br>
 twist to
 <br>
 mimic to
 <br>
 contain to
 <br>
 sell
 <br>
 it looks like everyone singing about a breakup for years
 <br>
 so many pathetic passes at political stance
 <br>
 apathetic whiteness and micro-trend nostalgia-mining
 <br>
 it looks like avoiding poor people black people trans people 
 <br>
 working in tech or living in a van or building a studio
 <br>
 and having an artist mixer next Wednesday 
 <br>
 always the folk rock post punk
 <br>
 the new country solo on the pale fender
 <br>
 the shoe gaze the shoe gaze is in
 <br>
 sounds like
 <br>
 the duplicator losing quality 
 <br>
 making a legend wear shein and letting him go thirsty 
 <br>
 don't even ask him how his day was
 <br>
 don’t go to New York you’ll never play
 <br>
 get all your friends to drink
 <br>
 get all your friends to smoke
 <br>
 have to take a bump to play a show
 <br>
 it looks like cutting a slab of your soul 
 <br>
 throwing it down to plate 
 <br>
 asking for less than a penny
 <br>
 <br>
 write a song 
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 get a band to play it 
 <br>
 then what?
 <br>
 beg some anti-labor fuck to think you’re well-liked enough and safe enough to be booked 
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 scream it on a stage 
 <br>
 then what?
 <br>
 put it in an album 
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 by the way release show on October first
 <br>
 talk about it all the time
 <br>
 and then go on tour 
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 have a child born into dust and gravel air
 <br>
 who you will have to see drown
 <br>
 burn like an egg on the pavement
 <br>
 and then what?
 <br>
 <br>
 continuous engagement
 <br>
 that’s what your fans want
 <br>
 spineless men who spend their earnings on defense technology
 <br>
 who do you sound like?
 <br>
 how warm is your sound?
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 what else can I do?
 <br>
 joy is plagiarized and consumed
 <br>
 my art is re-creatable, commercial, and provocative on banal value terms
 <br>
 I see the mill-churn
 <br>
 the milieu of hundreds of thousands branding themselves
 <br>
 the scent of rotting flesh reeks on the stage
 <br>
 I am not willing to fashion myself into a worthy inheritor
 <br>
 I cannot continue to pimp myself out to myself
 <br>
 I cannot bring myself to chase 15 seconds of attention
 <br>
 and yet still here I am
 <br>
 nothing risked
 <br>
 nothing risked
 <br>
 nothing risked
 <br>
 <br>
 and nothing lost but time time time
 <br>
 <br>
 in the face of everything 
 <br>
 I am refusing 
 <br>
 I refuse 
 <br>
 I have lived in comfort for too long
 <br>
 I must find others and cling to them purposefully
 <br>
 and reject the realism
 <br>
 reject inevitability 
 <br>
 reject consistent age-ed structure
 <br>
 <br>
 do not acquiesce my love
 <br>
 do not let them steal a healthy life away from your children
 <br>
 do not let them kill you
 <br>
 how hard alone is it to make meaning of your minutes
 <br>
 your life
 <br>
 and then to rearrange and synthesize into something you’re proud enough to sing
 <br>
 and now you must beat out everyone
 <br>
 claw their eyes out in favor of The Castle
 <br>
 the call center 
 <br>
 the likely scam
 <br>
 like A Night On Bald Mountain
 <br>
 they take your money 
 <br>
 they take it from every inch of the path they’ve laid out for you
 <br>
 the toll the toll the toll
 <br>
 <br>
 i am america's last great export
 <br>
 i am a dry turkey
 <br>
 i am so marketable you wouldn’t believe
