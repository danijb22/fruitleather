        I see it aging, the ideas and humor warping to staleness. A gross familiarity. We are old now. Our brutal ignorance no longer produces raw culture hewn from time, but heightens
        <br>
        our comfortability. We can no longer cling to the amateur’s lot. 
        <br>

        It used to make me uncomfortable hearing “Free Palestine” at a show. Like a lawn sign. Simply a “Free Palestine” and nothing else. It felt homogeneous and self-preserving. “Fuck
        <br>
        Donald Trump”. “Fuck Spotify” in another black square. “In this house we…”  In Aspen Hall, a woman stands up and cries angrily, “This talk is great and all, but no one is down 
        <br>
        here! We have one lawyer helping hundreds of people. Why aren’t you all here?”
        <br>
        <br>        
        It feels uncomfortable to be coming back into the app gulch and realize everyone is posting all these /things/. It makes me anxious and overwhelmed and my addictive actions come 
        <br>
        back. I HAVE to check. I HAVE to know. People posting constantly about actions and fundraisers and teach-ins and yet in all my years of being offline I haven’t heard of nearly 
        <br>
        one percent of what I assume people are sharing in online spaces. It feels dichotomous to remember I’ve been surrounded by people reading about these things every single day, 
        <br>
        and a sliver of that information has been shared in person with me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve found my action and peace through my own channels, but the shock keeps hitting me every time I flip through people’s stories. This information is so digestible, 
        <br>
        multiplicitous, and sane. Processed food for thought, all sugared up on canva, and most of it centered around a passé form of enraging the viewer. A dull call to arms. An acid 
        <br>
        reflux.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s a day after the 4th anniversary of the January 6th Q-Anon rumpus and it’s been four years of absolute dismay at my own stasis. I remember driving with my best friend on 
        <br>
        speaker phone. We’re both gawking wildly and yelling at each other, “We should’ve been there! I mean, why weren’t we all there?"
