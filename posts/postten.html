        So back in 2022 I made and posted a track that used audio from an interview with Viper after a show he had in Houston. In it he rambles on cyclically about a lot of things, but I chose bits from his tangent about The Rapture—the possibility of God taking us to a better place and in that instant, being forced to leave this world behind. Could you do it? He asked. Let go of your Earthly desires and attachments and accept a new life or world or consciousness or whatever? 
<br> <br>
        In chilling retrospect it would be easy for someone so truly stricken with evil to talk freely about detachment and a readiness to escape our world. Whatever I admired in him as an artist is completely gone. May God leave him here when judgement day comes.
