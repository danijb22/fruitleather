        Another year over, a new one just for fun.

        Guys… 
        
        Guys… Gahyize… It just so happens we’re’ve done it again. 2024 ended. Oh boy and what a year it was. As a band we’ve achieved so much. Man! So many new musical friends, tried new things and played new places for the first time. I’m really really grateful for what 2024 was. We grew as people and as musicians in such grand and unexpected ways and I believe we’re so much stronger for it. And to top it off, we ended our year putting our new songs on wax.
        
        Thanks to everyone ever who said “yes yes yes!” To us <3

        Should mold abrasives be in snot
        And never put on rye?
        Should mold abrasives be in snot
        In the haze of old dang fries?
        
        For old, dang fries my dear
        For old dang fries!
        We’ll stink it up with slimes and sweat
        For the sake with old dang fries!
