        This lady on the Greyhound bus is trying to get through to Alex, but he hasn’t been available for a couple hours. 

<b><b>

Her ability to remember names and races (..”a little Hispanic guy dropped me off in the freezing rain..”, “.. A big Black guy took my papers and I don’t know what he did with them…” “Brenda”) is accurate and warped, but she’s too scattered to be as adjusted as the rest of the bus.

<b><b>

She hasn’t had a boyfriend in 16 years but, “you can still find someone”. Which is so true. You can always find someone. Like Teresa, she found Teresa who was sitting a row or two behind her and Teresa lent her her phone to call Alex. After going to her grandfather’s funeral Teresa ended up in a psych ward for a spell. She’s good but, “still a little crazy”. 

<b><b>

I like the way that Susan Perry, the woman without a phone, says “…awww”, and Teresa mirrors it. “Awww” they say, exhaling empathic tones strongly across the bus. “Aww”, I’m sorry, “Aww” so sweet. I feel comforted by it. It feels real. 

<b><b>

She almost got stuck in the Loves. The bus took a break for a cool 12 minutes and I ate my tired gesture at a sandwich: Aldi cheese sticks and refrigerated sourdough bread. When we all started making the short pilgrimage back to the bus, I realized she wasn’t there, and most likely didn’t have a way to tell time. 

<b><b>

I let the bus driver know and ran back in to grab her. I waited for her as she told the Hardy’s kitchen she needed her sandwich and held the door but then, because I didn’t feel like getting into a deeper relationship with her, I walked a bit ahead and found my seat before she had even entered the bus.

<b><b>

“Here you go”. It’s Alex on the phone. The “big black” security guard is still the scapegoat, as well as whatever organization that Alex works for. And whatever organization that Alex works for apparently gave her a bus ticket that through a series of confusing turnarounds and once again and again a “big black guy”, her ticket didn’t work out so now she’s got no money because she had to buy her own. 

<b><b>

She’s starting to get upset, explaining her case to the man who works it, who I cannot hear. But when she talked to Teresa (and the whole bus) at length about the death of her daughter, there was no emotion. She’s oozing with layers of calcified grief, shifted and rustled up by the screwed ticket. She doesn’t want to go back to Sioux Falls, she cannot go back.

<b><b>

She makes me think of what Jan must sound like on the phone. Apparently Susan Perry is 65, and Jan is 88. You can tell when someone is old, because of the way her lips get in the way of her teeth. It makes it easy for some to discriminate and dismiss older folks. Makes people seem drunk. 

<b><b>

“That lady with the Black Hair”. I barely remember things like this. I don’t know why I want to keep my distance from her. I remember when I was younger, and less stable, we would definitely be talking right now, sharing our life stories or probably me listening to hers. I don’t feel she is dangerous, but I’m just not interested in extending myself in ways I know I do. I feel like a part of the cold public around her. 

<b><b>

Alex is struggling with the bureaucracy on speakerphone. “If I possibly could…” “In a perfect world…” “I wish…”, They can’t refund the money she lost. He can’t personally refund her $100 dollars. Alex is incredibly sweet. He’s trying his best. 

<b><b>

“Can you call them right now. Please because I’m on my deathbed, and my heart is acting up, and I can’t take it. I can’t do it Alex. So call them, call them please, right now.”

<b><b>

“Okay.”

<b><b>

“Okay?”

<b><b>

When Jan tells me what has happened to her, she tells it multiple times. It’s not necessarily because she forgets, but because it’s almost compulsive. Like she has to say it so many times because neither she, nor I, can hear, can understand the gravity. “He told me to shut up! Shut up!”
